# PROTOLIZE!

PROTOLIZE! is a MATLAB suite to process many kinds of biological signals. Initially [made](http://repositorio.unb.br/bitstream/10482/4213/1/2009_SergioAndresCondeOcazionez.pdf) by professor [Sergio Ocazionez](http://buscatextual.cnpq.br/buscatextual/visualizacv.do?id=K4245801A8) from the [Brain Institute](http://www.neuro.ufrn.br/incerebro/), it is now being worked on in the Neurosciences and Behaviour Laboratory of University of Brasilia, given its widespread use in many researches from this lab.

Here, we include the original version of this software in the folder P1, and a new version (WHICH IS NOT READY YET) in the P2 folder. To run them, open MATLAB and run either the `protolize.m` (for P1) or the `protolize2.m` (for P2) scripts.
