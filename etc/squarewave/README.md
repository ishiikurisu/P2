# Square wave

The goal for this set of scripts is to identify when an event happenned based on an edge-triggered signal.

Idea: apply the Hilbert transform on the signal and identify the positive edges as inflexions on the transformed signal. Based on their nature, we can apply a _1V_ threshold with an used defined cooldown time, suggested to be _1s_.

The `main.m` script is whole procedure, from reading the EDF file to relating its data on the _DC_ channel to the table generated by _E-prime_.

The `test.m` script is a test of the mathematical tools to be used on this procedure.
