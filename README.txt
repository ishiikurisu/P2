# PROTOLIZE!

PROTOLIZE! is an educational MATLAB DSP suite to process many kinds of biological signals. Initially [made](http://repositorio.unb.br/bitstream/10482/4213/1/2009_SergioAndresCondeOcazionez.pdf) by professor [Sergio Ocazionez](http://lattes.cnpq.br/7159531395590165) from the [Brain Institute](http://www.neuro.ufrn.br/incerebro/), it is now being worked on in the Laboratory of Neuroscience and Behaviour in the University of Brasilia, given its widespread use in many researches from this lab.

PROTOLIZE! comes with two folders: P2 (the graphical user interface with tools and facilities for studying and executing signal processing tasks) and P2Lib (a library containing some useful functions for signal processing).

To run PROTOLIZE!, open MATLAB and run the `protolize.m` script.

PROTOLIZE! also comes with an extensive documentation inside itself, in the "Read Documentation" window inside the "Help" toolbar.

To include the PROTOLIZE! library to your MATLAB path, run the `addP2Lib.m` script on this root folder.
